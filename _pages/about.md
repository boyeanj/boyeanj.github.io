I'm planning on using this as a place to keep track of my personal projects.  My primary area of interest is macroeconomics, though as long as a topic is somewhat related to either economics or mathematics I tend to find it fascinating.   

As President of Economics Club, I provide a place for people of all backgrounds to learn about economics and engage in discussion.  In coordination with the rest of the executive team, I also started the Economics Club Project Team, which is currently completing an Economic Impact Report for a local organization.  

My academic interests extend beyond the classroom through my involvement with Miami University's Federal Reserve Challenge Team, where I served as a presenter and researcher. In this role, I investigated potential risks to the US economy stemming from Financial, International, and Housing Sectors.

In the workplace, I have gained hands-on professional experience as an intern at a small consulting firm, Chmura Economics and Analytics, where I contributed to client projects by conducting research, and I was able to automate the data collection for over 20,000 real estate parcels.  

I am also an Assistant Trip Leader for the Miami University Outdoor Pursuit Center (OPC), where I get the opportunity to help lead students in Backpacking, Rock Climbing and occasionally Kayaking trips!  Other roles I have at the OPC include Rock Climbing Class Teacher's Assistant, and Route Setter.
