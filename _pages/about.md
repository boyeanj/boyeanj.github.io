### About Me
I am pursuing a B.S. in Quantitative Economics and an M.A. in Economics through Miami University’s 3+1 program, preparing for a career in economic research. My current interests include macroeconomic theory, expectations formation, and credit default swaps.  

### Research Experience
In summer 2025, I completed a research internship at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, assisting Dr. Joe Haubrich and Dr. Ned Prescott on financial regulation and banking projects. My work included locating and summarizing qualitative data, analyzing public Home Mortgage Disclosure Act datasets, and creating a web scraper to automate business contact verification — a tool expected to save up to 30 hours of manual work annually.  

At Miami University, I have further developed my research skills as a presenter and researcher for the Federal Reserve Challenge Team, where I analyzed potential economic risks in the financial, international, and housing sectors.  

### Professional & Leadership Experience
Previously, I worked as an Economic Intern at Chmura Economics and Analytics, contributing to client projects by conducting research and automating data collection for over 20,000 real estate parcels. As President of the Economics Club, I organize career panels and foster connections among students interested in economics.  

### Beyond Economics
Outside of academics, I am a routesetter at Miami University’s Outdoor Pursuit Center, with prior roles as Assistant Trip Leader and Rock Climbing Teaching Assistant.

I am pursuing a B.S. in Quantitative Economics and a M.A. in Economics through the Miami University 3+1 program as preparation for a career in economic research.  My current interests include macroeconomic theory, expectations, and credit default swaps.

This summer, I completed a Research Internship at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, where I assisted Dr. Joe Haubrich and Dr. Ned Prescott in their research on financial regulation and banking.  In addition to locating and summarizing qualitative data, I worked with various datasets, including public Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.  Through this work, I learned the importance of understanding the complex regulatory environment of financial institutions.  Additionally, I had the privilege of creating a web scraper to automate some verification of business contact information.  Automating this process is expected to save up to 30 hours annually.

My academic interests extend beyond the classroom through my involvement with Miami University's Federal Reserve Challenge Team, where I served as a presenter and researcher. In this role, I investigated potential risks to the US economy stemming from Financial, International, and Housing Sectors.

In the workplace, I gained professional experience as an Economic Intern at a small consulting firm, Chmura Economics and Analytics. There, I contributed to client projects by conducting research and automated data collection for over 20,000 real estate parcels.  

As President of Economics Club, I organize career panels and provide a space for motivated students to connect with each other and learn about economics.  

I am also a routesetter for the rock wall at Miami University Outdoor Pursuit Center (OPC). Roles I previously held include Assistant Trip Leader and Rock Climbing Teacher's Assistant.
