I am a Quantitative Economics Major and 3+1 Masters Candidate at Miami University. Here you can find some personal projects as well as my resume, feel free to reach out if you have questions or comments.  My primary area of interest is macroeconomics. 

As President of Economics Club, I provide a place for people of all backgrounds to learn about economics and engage in discussion.  In coordination with the rest of the executive team, I also started the Economics Club Project Team, which is currently completing an Economic Impact Report for a local organization.  

My academic interests extend beyond the classroom through my involvement with Miami University's Federal Reserve Challenge Team, where I served as a presenter and researcher. In this role, I investigated potential risks to the US economy stemming from Financial, International, and Housing Sectors.

In the workplace, I gained professional experience as an Economic Intern at a small consulting firm, Chmura Economics and Analytics. There, I contributed to client projects by conducting research and automated data collection for over 20,000 real estate parcels.  

I am also an Assistant Trip Leader for the Miami University Outdoor Pursuit Center (OPC), where I get the opportunity to help lead students in Backpacking, Rock Climbing and occasionally Kayaking trips!  Other roles I have at the OPC include Rock Climbing Class Teacher's Assistant, and Route Setter.
