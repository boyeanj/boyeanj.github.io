This is a Numberphile-inspired short programming project that randomly generates a "stitch pattern" composed of horizontal and vertical lines that either begin on a dash or a "hole".  For more information about Hitomezashi stitch patterns, I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/JbfhzlMk2eY?feature=shared">Numberphile video</a> that inspired the creation of this program.

Below is an example, and feel free to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UY2D6jbhFFY2dt1mGF29r0XTV6thEDwO?usp=sharing">Open this in Google Colab</a> to generate your own patterns!
